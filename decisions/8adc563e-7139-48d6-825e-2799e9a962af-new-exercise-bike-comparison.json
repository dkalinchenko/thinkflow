        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "The steel frame is solid and stable with minimal wobble, supporting up to 297 lbs. However, some users report occasional creaking over time, and the premium feel comes with proprietary components that require Peloton service."

        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "At 59\" L x 53\" H x 23\" W, it requires significant dedicated space. The 140 lb weight makes it difficult to move despite front wheels, essentially requiring a permanent installation location."

        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "At $2,495 plus $44/month subscription for full functionality, it's among the most expensive home bikes. The value proposition depends entirely on whether you'll consistently use the subscription content—otherwise it's overpriced hardware."

        "explanation": "The leaning feature provides exceptional ride dynamics that engage core muscles, creating a more immersive and full-body workout. The magnetic resistance system is smooth and quiet, with a heavy flywheel (22-25 lbs) that delivers realistic road-like feel and consistent momentum."

      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "The seat is firm and may require aftermarket padding for extended rides, though it's adjustable. Handlebars offer multiple grip positions and adjust well, but some users report discomfort during intense leaning workouts where core engagement is high."

      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "The bike feels solid and stable even during maximum leaning, with a weight capacity of 325 lbs. However, some early models had reported issues with the leaning mechanism's durability over time, though Bowflex has addressed many concerns."

        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "At approximately 59\" L x 21\" W x 55\" H, it requires significant floor space. The bike is heavy (around 140 lbs) and while it has transport wheels, moving it is challenging due to its size and weight."
      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Priced around $2,200-$2,500, it's expensive compared to basic stationary bikes. The leaning feature and large screen justify some premium, but the mandatory JRNY subscription ($19.99/month) adds substantial ongoing cost."

        "explanation": "The 40 lb flywheel provides smooth, quiet magnetic resistance with 100 micro-adjustable levels, offering commercial-grade feel. While excellent, some high-end competitors offer heavier flywheels for slightly more inertia."
      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Four-way adjustable seat and handlebars accommodate most users, but the stock seat is firm and often replaced. Adjustability is good but not exceptional compared to premium models with more ergonomic options."

      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 4,

      },
      "criterion-4": {
        "value": 3,

      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 4,

      "criterion-0": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "The magnetic resistance provides smooth transitions, but the 22 lb flywheel is lighter than premium bikes, limiting momentum and realism. Resistance levels are adequate for most users but lack the high-end feel of heavier flywheel systems."
      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "The seat is basic and often reported as uncomfortable for longer sessions, requiring aftermarket replacements. Adjustability is limited compared to higher-end models, with fewer handlebar and seat positioning options."
      },
      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "The frame is stable for typical use but feels less substantial than commercial-grade bikes. Weight capacity (300 lbs) is standard, but some users report minor wobble at higher intensities."
      },
      "criterion-3": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "Bluetooth connectivity works reliably with the Echelon app, providing good metrics tracking. The console is basic but functional, though it lacks built-in screen and relies entirely on external devices."
      },
      "criterion-4": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "Compact design fits well in home spaces, and transport wheels make moving relatively easy. It's not the smallest available but balances stability with reasonable space requirements."
      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "At its price point, it delivers solid smart bike features and class access that competitors charge more for. However, the subscription model for classes adds ongoing cost, and build compromises are noticeable versus premium bikes."
