        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "The Max Trainer uses a unique 14-inch vertical stride pattern rather than traditional elliptical motion. While this provides intense climbing simulation, it lacks the natural elliptical feel and adjustability of stride length found on dedicated ellipticals."

        "value": 4,

      },
      "criterion-4": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "While marketed as low-impact, the steep climbing motion creates significant quad and knee strain compared to traditional ellipticals. The vertical stride pattern is more joint-intensive than smooth elliptical gliding motions."
      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Priced at a premium for its feature set, but the specialized hybrid design may not suit all users seeking traditional elliptical motion. Better value for those specifically wanting climbing simulation rather than pure elliptical low-impact cardio."

      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "Magnetic resistance system offers 20 levels with smooth transitions, though some users report minor noise at higher levels. The system is reliable but not the absolute quietest available."

      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 5,

      "criterion-3": {
        "value": 3,

      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Silent Magnetic Resistance provides quiet operation and decent smoothness across its levels. The range and torque may be limited compared to more robust magnetic systems, placing it as average for home use."
      },
      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "As a budget-friendly, space-saving model, stability and durability are compromised with a lighter frame and lower weight capacity. It may feel less solid during intense workouts compared to premium ellipticals."

      "criterion-3": {
        "value": 4,

      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 3,

      },
      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Solid for a home machine with a 350 lb capacity, but some users report minor creaking over time and it lacks the overbuilt feel of true commercial units. It's stable during use but not exceptionally heavy-duty."
      },
      "criterion-3": {
        "value": 5,
        "explanation": "Outstanding feature set with automatic incline/decline, iFit integration (live and on-demand coaching), interactive Google Maps workouts, and a large touchscreen console. The automatic stride adjustment during workouts is a game-changing innovation."
      },
      "criterion-4": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "Provides excellent low-impact exercise with smooth motion that's easy on joints. The variable stride allows users to find their most comfortable range, though the very longest strides might feel slightly less natural to some."
      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "At a premium price point (often $2000+), it's expensive, and the mandatory iFit subscription adds significant ongoing cost. While innovative, the total cost of ownership is high compared to many capable ellipticals."
