        "explanation": "The Dyson V15 Detect delivers exceptional suction power with its Hyperdymium motor, effectively cleaning carpets, hard floors, and embedded debris. Its laser dust detection reveals microscopic particles, ensuring thorough cleaning performance across all surfaces."
      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 5,
        "explanation": "Features a fully sealed HEPA filtration system that captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, including allergens and bacteria. The advanced filtration prevents expelled air from reintroducing contaminants, making it excellent for allergy sufferers."
      },
      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "Comes with multiple attachments including a laser fluffy head, hair screw tool, and combination tool for various surfaces and pet hair. While versatile, some specialized attachments require separate purchase, slightly limiting out-of-box flexibility."

      "criterion-3": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Offers approximately 60 minutes of runtime in eco mode, but only 20-30 minutes in max power mode. This may be insufficient for larger homes without recharging, requiring strategic cleaning sessions or mid-job charging."
      },
      "criterion-4": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "At 6.8 pounds, it's relatively lightweight for its power class and features excellent balance for easy maneuvering and stair use. However, the wand design can feel top-heavy during extended use compared to some competitors."
      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "Priced at a premium ($700+), it represents significant investment for cleaning technology. While performance is excellent, the high cost and battery limitations make it poor value for budget-conscious consumers or those with large homes."

      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "While it includes a HEPA filter that captures allergens, some users report fine dust leakage during emptying. It performs adequately for most households but falls short of premium sealed-system filtration found in higher-end models."
      },
      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "Excellent for pet hair with specialized attachments and transitions well between carpet and hardwood. The LED headlights are useful, though some users find the accessory selection more limited compared to full-sized corded vacuums."
      },
      "criterion-3": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "Runtime is limited to about 30 minutes on high power, requiring frequent recharging for larger homes. Battery degradation over time further reduces effective cleaning sessions, making it unsuitable for extended cleaning tasks."

      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 3,

        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Effective on hard floors and low-pile carpets but struggles with deep-pile carpets and embedded debris compared to high-power upright vacuums. Robot vacuums generally have lower suction than traditional models."
      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 4,

      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 2,

      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "Includes a multi-level filtration system but lacks a true HEPA filter, which limits allergen capture for sensitive users. Fine dust and pet dander may not be fully contained, making it less suitable for severe allergy sufferers."

      },
      "criterion-3": {
        "value": 1,

      },
      "criterion-4": {
        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Swivel steering provides good maneuverability on flat surfaces, but the upright design and moderate weight make it cumbersome on stairs. Carrying it between floors requires noticeable effort."
      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 4,
