      },
      "criterion-4": {
        "value": 5,
        "explanation": "Exceptionally easy to use - resistance adjustments require only changing the incline angle via a simple pin system. No weight plates to load/unload, making transitions between exercises and users very quick."

      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 3,
