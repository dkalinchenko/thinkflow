        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "The slim profile is comfortable for all-day wear and sleep tracking, but the display is relatively small and difficult to read in bright sunlight. Water resistance is good for swimming, but the band material can cause irritation for some users."

      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "At its premium price point, the Charge 6 faces stiff competition from more affordable alternatives with similar features. The mandatory Fitbit Premium subscription for full data insights significantly increases the total cost of ownership."

        "value": 3,
        "explanation": "Heart rate and step tracking are generally reliable for daily use, but sleep monitoring can be inconsistent and calorie estimates lack precision compared to more advanced sensors. It's acceptable for casual fitness tracking but not for rigorous data analysis."
      },
      "criterion-1": {
        "value": 4,
        "explanation": "Lasts up to 7 days on a single charge, which is above average for fitness trackers with continuous heart rate monitoring. However, enabling SpO2 or GPS features significantly reduces this duration, placing it below top performers in the category."

      "criterion-2": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "Lacks built-in GPS (requires phone connection), has limited workout modes compared to competitors, and SpO2 monitoring is basic. Body Battery and stress tracking are useful but don't compensate for missing core features expected at this price point."

      },
      "criterion-5": {
        "value": 2,
        "explanation": "Priced similarly to competitors with more advanced features like built-in GPS and better sensors. The premium cost isn't justified given the feature limitations and average tracking accuracy, making it a poor value proposition compared to alternatives."

        "value": 4,
